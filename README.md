# BirdSAT: Cross-View Contrastive Masked Autoencoders for Bird Species Classification and Mapping

## ü¶¢ Dataset Released: Cross-View iNAT Birds 2021
This cross-view birds species dataset consists
of paired ground-level bird images and satellite images, along with meta-information associated with the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

#### Computer Vision Tasks
1. Fine-Grained image classification
2. Satellite-to-bird image retrieval
3. Bird-to-satellite image retrieval
4. Geolocalization of Bird Images

An example of task 3 is shown below:

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Started 

#### Installing Required Packages
There are two options to setup your environment to be able to run all the functions in the repository:
1. Using Dockerfile provided in the repository to create a docker image with all required packages:
    ```bash
    docker build -t <your-docker-hub-id>/birdsat .
    ```
2. Creating conda Environment with all required packages:
    ```bash
    conda create -n birdsat python=3.10 && \
    conda activate birdsat && \
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```

Additionally, we have hosted a pre-built docker image on docker hub with tag `srikumar26/birdsat:latest` for use.

#### Data Preparation
Please refer to `./data/README.md` on instructions for downloading and preparing data.

## üî• Training Models
1. Setup all the parameters of interest inside `config.py` before launching the training script.
2. Run pre-training by calling:
    ```bash
    python pretrain.py
    ```
3. Run fine-tuning by calling:
    ```bash
    python finetune.py
    ```
